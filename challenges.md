# Challenges

### Virtual Machines

This was one of my first times using Hyper-V Manager and creating a virtual machine to isolate my environment and it was quite an interesting journey. At the beginning, I was a bit intimidated with the setup and figured that if I knew what I was doing, I could start off this project on my own machine and move to the virtual machine once things got complicated. However, failing to consider how my enterprise security screen would work, I received an interesting message from the security team at my place of work.

Even after getting the virtual machine working, I faced a few challenges in getting everything working as I planned it. Turns out establishing a reverse shell connection while working on a virtual machine is not as easy as it appears to be. I was not able to run WSL on my virtual machine for what I imagined was a challenge of nested virtualisation. However, I managed to work around this after hours of playing around with this virtual machine and recognising that ncat would also work on Windows. 

### Obfuscation + Debugging

The `r1` file, which executes a reverse shell connection to the remote host, required heavy obfuscation to not be picked up by Windows Defender as a malicious file. It was quite an interesting experience learning how to obfuscate these files using a vast range of strategies (outlined in report).
